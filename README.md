# Random Password Generator

This Python program generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria, including minimum length, the inclusion of numbers, and the inclusion of special characters.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `generate_password.py` file is located.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python generate_password.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to specify your password requirements:

Enter the minimum password length.
Choose whether you want to include numbers (type 'y' for yes or 'n' for no).
Choose whether you want to include special characters (type 'y' for yes or 'n' for no).
The program will generate a random password that meets your criteria and display it on the screen.

You can use the generated password for your accounts or applications.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the program:

Enter the minimum length: 12
Do you want to have numbers (y/n)? y
Do you want to have special characters (y/n)? y

The generated password is:  AbC$5rT*8fG!
